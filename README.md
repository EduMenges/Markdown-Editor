# Markdown-Editor

This is a project that was completed by reading the chapter 2 of the book "Advanced TypeScript Projects", in which I built a basic markdown to HTML editor.

The book focused heavily on OOP concepts, and, in my opinion, made the project unnecessarily complex. That's why there are 2 files:

1. **MarkupHandler.ts** — the book version
2. **MyMarkupHandler.ts** — my version

I tried to stick to OOP, so I didn't make any functions, but I kind of cheated by doing a class of abstracted methods, but it made sense, at least in my head. I would very much prefer to use only functional for this project, since all that is required is that a data goes in, and another data goes out, which is perfect for functions, but I **really** need to learn OOP and get out of my comfort zone.
